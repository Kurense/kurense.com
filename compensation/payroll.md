# Cost-effective payroll solution.

KurensÄ“ helps companies whose employees don't use or have bank accounts by
allowing employees to receive their pay directly on payroll cards, without
the traditional overhead costs of issuing checks.

We provide employees with an easy-to-use alternative to traditional banking
and check-cashing services &mdash; without the worry of going into debt,
overdrawing an account, or incurring costly fees.

Also, our payroll card programs are fully integrated with online financial
literacy education and money management tools that help employees manage
their money more effectively.
