  ICS provides insurance companies, government agencies, and relief
  organizations branded prepaid cards to pay for necessities in the aftermath
  of a disaster (e.g., natural disaster or house fire). Cardholders can access
  funds immediately to make replacement purchase or secure items such as hotel
  rooms, food or clothing after a significant loss.

  Our prepaid insurance cards enables insurers to reduce costs, improve
  existing payment processes, and most importantly, provide claimants with
  better service.
