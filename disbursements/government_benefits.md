# Helping federal and state governments distribute benefits.

Federal and state governments can distribute benefits (e.g., child support,
unemployment insurance, TANIF) using an KurensÄ“ prepaid card rather than a check. 

Funds are immediately available. There are no checks to cash, the cards are
usable at many merchant locations and have bill-paying capabilities and they
keep funds segregated for easy accountability.
