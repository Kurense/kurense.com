# Get emergency funds to disaster victims&mdash;fast.

ICS provides insurance companies, government agencies, and relief
organizations branded prepaid cards to pay for necessities in the aftermath
of a disaster (e.g., natural disaster or house fire). Cardholders can access
funds immediately to make replacement purchase or secure items such as hotel
rooms, food or clothing after a significant loss.

Our prepaid insurance cards enables insurers to reduce costs, improve
existing payment processes, and most importantly, provide claimants with
better service.
