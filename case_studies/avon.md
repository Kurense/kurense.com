# The Challenge

Avon Representatives are the economic engine of their business. To show their
appreciation, Avon wanted to reimburse travel expense to members of its
Execute Leadership Team.

# The Solution

Avon turned to KurensÄ“, which helped design a fully
custom-branded Avon program that created a better overall employee
reimbursement experience and even greater brand recognition.

# The Result

The fully branded Avon Prepaid MasterCard creates a more positive and lasting
impression on their representatives than paper checks and provides a
compelling marketing tool for their direct sales channel.
