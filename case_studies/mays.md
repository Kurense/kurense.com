# The Challenge

Mays Chemical was in need of a reliable, cost-effective solution to help
their employees, who don't have or use a traditional bank accounts receive

these employees.

# The Solution

KurensÄ“ worked with Mays Chemical to create a customized payroll solution that
provides direct deposit of all employee payrolls onto their personal cards.
By changing payroll payments from paper checks to reloadable prepaid cards,
Mays Chemical has the ability to instantly deposit funds to 100% of its
employee base, even to those who do not have bank accounts.

# The Result

With the Mays Payroll Card, now all pay is delivered 100% electronically
either by payroll cards or direct deposit.
