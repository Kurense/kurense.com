# The Solution

ICS's program eliminated the university's paper checks as well as long lines
at the business office and also made a host of financial literacy tools
available.

# The Result

ICS helped FMU's 1,800 students better manage their money and understand
crucial tools such as monthly budgeting and using text messaging and e-mail
to stay on top of their spending.
